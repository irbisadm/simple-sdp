# Simple SDP tools
This project is a TypeScript library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages in WebRTC applications. SDP is a text-based format that describes the multimedia communication sessions between peers. 
With this library, you can:
- Parse and generate SDP messages from and to TypeScript objects
- Manipulate SDP data by adding, removing, or modifying media streams, codecs, candidates, and other attributes
- Validate SDP messages according to the RFC 4566 specification and WebRTC best practices
- Track and verify the SDP history for a single PeerConnection instance

This project aims to help WebRTC beginners learn the SDP format and its components, as well as provide a clear and easy-to-use TypeScript API for advanced users. This project was inspired by the [pjsip](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject) library written in C++.
